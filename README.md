# Setup

To succesfully run the project you need to create ```.env``` file inside **server** folder with following key-value pairs:

```
DB_URI = 'your mongo db connection string'
JWT_KEY = 'man i love sneks'
```

(and also don't forget to ```npm i``` in both **client** and **server** directories)
